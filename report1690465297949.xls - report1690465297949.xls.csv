Butchershop,USD,3667,11/14/2022,Americas,United States,Small Business,Product,Data (coverage/language/quantity),"Overall, we are skeptical about the trustworthiness and robustness of the data and data sources. There is too heavy of an emphasis on Twitter, and although the platform does pull from other sources like news and forums, it feels imbalanced and skewed towards Twitter, particularly the audience & demographic insights. Many of our client projects are in the B2B space, so we hoped to see more capabilities with publically available LinkedIn data - which we were told was part of the product roadmap during the sales process and have yet to see this introduced. We also believed that there would be more capabilities to leverage data from review sites as part of the core product and have been underwhelmed in that area. We are unable to leverage the 50 Instagram and 50 Facebook channels, which I believe comes standard with the platform, but because we do not manage any social media accounts for our clients it's a data source we don't have access to and can't use beyond just monitoring our own corporate Instagram channel. We understand this is a limitation of the current data privacy and API restrictions for those channels, but it's led us to question the long-term value and risks of Brandwatch as privacy regulations and restrictions continue to evolve across all platforms. In other words, we're anticipating that access to data will become even more limited rather than more expansive and inclusive of the types of sources we'd be most interested in. For an organization of our size, the 20 queries we were told we needed for our package during the sales process is too many and we are not able to utilize them all. And lastly, the onboarding period & online coaching experience was sub-par. It felt unnecessarily prolonged and our rep appeared to be unfamiliar with the platform features and did not demonstrate expertise. The custom query and dashboard delivered as part of the onboarding package was disappointing and made me feel that I knew how to use the platform better than our coach.",,Brandwatch Premium Research;,Q4-2022

EY Korea,USD,24680,4/1/2023,APAC,"Korea, Republic of",Large Business,Other,Other,"Unfortunately EY Korea have finally responded and advised that they will not be renewing. Here's a bit of context on the situation: - My understanding is that the EY Korea relationship was passed over from the brand CSM team to the agency team in September 2022 (From Jen Wilder to Anna Alber). - When handing the account over, the brand team flagged that there was a high risk of churn due to use of Sprinklr at Samsung and Samsung's internal S-Core agency potentially taking the business back from EY. This is detailed in Jen Wilder's handover document. - I returned from maternity leave this year and was handed EY Korea at the end of January 2023, with Anna Alber leaving Brandwatch. - Anna introduced me to the client over email but the client has never acknowledged the change in CSM or responded to any requests for an introductory call / product roadmap. - The only communication we have had with the client this year is through a user (Areum) raising a support ticket about data discrepancies. Following the support responses, Areum requested clarification and a link to the Brandwatch SLAs. Due to the timezone difference, the support team took a while to investigate the issue because each time they responded to Areum, it was outside of their working hours. - I strongly feel that the account would have benefitted throughout the contract if managed by an APAC CSM within their timezone and if we had APAC based tech support. - Platform logins were at a good level throughout. - We contacted the client about the renewal on many occasions and had zero response. This included creating Intercom in-app messages that pop up to users within the platform. - Erica Millstein also reached out to her EY US contacts and asked for them to help put us in touch with the right person in Korea. - The subscription expired and the users were locked on 3rd of April. Alex sent an exec outreach email to again request a response to the renewal. - On 4th April we finally received a response from Areum stating the below: ""Dear BCR team, We've been thankful for BCR's suppot so far. Sorry but we won't extend the contact. It'd been a really great time with BCR. It'd be appreciated if we can make a connection next time. I wish you all the best, BCR team. Thank you again.

Their other licences (such as Carat and iProspect) are highly discounted as they were taken out many years ago and we can only raise Dentsu rates by 5% at each renewal (due to the MSA). There has also been high staff turnover at Dentsu X which means there are no experienced BW users there currently. This plus the higher cost of the subscription has resulted in the decision to cancel the Dentsu X license.
